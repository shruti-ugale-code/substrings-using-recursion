# 🎯 Substrings Using Recursion

**Explore the Power of Recursion**  
This project dives deep into the world of string subsequences, generating all possible combinations, including ASCII value representations. Through the elegance of recursion, every character in a string is explored in three ways: included, excluded, or replaced by its ASCII value. The result is a comprehensive list of subsequences, showcasing the flexibility and depth of recursive algorithms.

## 🚀 Features
- **Generate subsequences**: Explore every possible subsequence of a string.
- **ASCII magic**: Convert characters into their ASCII values and include them in the subsequences.
- **Recursive approach**: Simplifies complex problems by breaking them down.

## 🛠️ How It Works
The program uses recursion to handle each character in the input string, branching out into different paths:
1. **Include the character** in the current subsequence.
2. **Exclude the character** and move forward.
3. **Replace the character** with its ASCII value.

Each path is explored until the string is fully processed, and the results are merged into a final list.

## 📂 Files Included
- `ascii_Val.java`: Generates subsequences with ASCII conversions.
- `ascii_in_list_subarr.java`: Combines subsequences and ASCII in a list.
- `asciival_substring.java`: Explores ASCII substitution within substrings.
- `subseq_in_arraylist.java`: Manages subsequences within an ArrayList.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage
Clone the repository and run the Java files to see the magic of recursion unfold. Experiment with different strings to observe how the subsequences are generated.
